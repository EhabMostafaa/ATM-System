This ATM System Project comprises two primary components: the design and construction of its architecture, the creation of a verification environment, and the development of test cases. We utilized the UVM environment, incorporating coverage and assertions.
This work was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Eman El-mandoui.

-	The project aims to practice Digital Design by implementing the core of the bank ATM design and verification for design.
-	ATM System design contains the following auxiliaries: 
• Card handling
• Language used
• Card password
• Timers	• Operation (Deposit – Withdraw –Balance service)
• Balance exists
• Deposit value
• Withdraw value 
-	Digital Verification by implementing UVM environment:
-	Design properties and assertion using SVA, create coverage model using a combination between cover properties, and cover groups and enable code coverage, and create coverage report for Statement, Branch, and FSM Coverage.
